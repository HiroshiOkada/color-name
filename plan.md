## Plan for Fixing Vulnerabilities

### Overview

This plan outlines the steps to address the vulnerabilities in the project by updating dependencies.

### Steps

1.  **Create a new branch:** Create a new branch named `fix-vulnerabilities` to isolate the changes.
2.  **Remove dependencies and clean:**
    *   Remove all dependencies from `package.json`.
    *   Delete `package-lock.json`.
    *   Delete the `node_modules/` directory.
3.  **Install packages:**
    *   Use `npm ls` to inspect the dependency tree and identify top-level dependencies.
    *   Install the identified packages one by one, without specifying versions (e.g., `npm install react`).
    *   After each package installation, run `npm audit fix` to attempt to automatically fix any vulnerabilities. If it fails, run `npm audit fix --force`.
4.  **Build and fix errors:**
    *   Run the build command (e.g., `npm run build`).
    *   If there are build errors, analyze the source code and fix them.
    *   Repeat the build process until there are no errors.

### Detailed Steps

1.  **Create a new branch:**

    *   Execute the command `git checkout -b fix-vulnerabilities`.
2.  **Remove dependencies and clean:**

    *   Read the contents of `package.json`.
    *   Create a new `package.json` with only the basic project information (name, version, etc.) but without any dependencies.
    *   Delete `package-lock.json` and `node_modules/`.
3.  **Install packages:**

    *   Run `npm ls` to inspect the dependency tree.
    *   Identify the top-level dependencies from the output of `npm ls`.
    *   Install the identified packages one by one using `npm install <package-name>`.
    *   After each installation, run `npm audit fix`. If it reports errors or doesn't fix all vulnerabilities, run `npm audit fix --force`.
4.  **Build and fix errors:**

    *   Run the build command specified in the original `package.json` (e.g., `npm run build`).
    *   If there are build errors, analyze the source code and fix them.
    *   Repeat the build process until there are no errors.
